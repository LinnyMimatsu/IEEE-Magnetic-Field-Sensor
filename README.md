The IEEE-Magnetic-Field-Sensor.asc file must be ran in LT Spice to be able to change around the schematics

To club members: if you want to add on to this repository or update the code in here, message me on discord and I will add you as a collaborator.

**Reminders:**
- The Servo motor and Magnetic Field Sensor must be plugged into a power source in order to operate properly.
(I believe the Magnetic Field Sensor can be plugged into the 5V slot on the Arduino)

- The Sensor and Arduino must share the same ground

- **DO NOT** plug the servo motor in to the 5V or 3.3V pin on the Arduino.
